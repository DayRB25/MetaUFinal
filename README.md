Education
### 2. Problem Background
In low-income communities, students often face significant challenges due to a lack of skilled advisors and support services. The absence of trained professionals who can provide academic guidance and support can have detrimental effects, such as higher dropout rates and delayed graduation. Without proper guidance on things like course selection, graduation requirements, and extracurricular opportunities students may struggle to navigate their educational journey successfully, leading to insufficient preparation for college admissions and/or financial aid.

### 3. Problem Statement
How might we provide underserved students in low-income communities with equitable access to comprehensive advisor tools to support their academic journey and enhance their educational opportunities?

### 4. Product Description
The solution is an enterprise product marketed to schools. The product offers two comprehensive tools to students. The first is an automated recommendation system to provide them with a curated list of volunteer opportunities based on factors like location, skills, and time commitment. The second tool is a What-If? Academic planner that provides students with the ability to track their academic progress with respect to their state’s requirements while also providing future schedules optimized for working towards their desired majors, universities, and graduation dates.
